The seeds of this site were planted in Lent 2023, during a founder's reflection during eucharistic adoration.  Already a seasoned traveler, he had lately begun to place an emphasis on visiting holy sites during his trips, and was continuously surprised at how many he discovered.  The idea of a unified map complementing existing Catholic resources such as [Mass Times](https://masstimes.org/) and [GCatholic](http://www.gcatholic.org/) was born and took shape over the next few months.

Our Lord tells us, "Blessed are those who have not seen and have believed" ([Jn 20:29](https://bible.usccb.org/bible/john/20)).  As we strive to reach this ideal, the authors' hope is that this website helps the faithful connect with tangible testaments to our Christian faith.  This "World of God" invites us to visit, pray and reflect at holy sites - on the virtues of the saints who trod there, on the messages of our Blessed Mother, and ultimately on how we may grow closer to Christ.
