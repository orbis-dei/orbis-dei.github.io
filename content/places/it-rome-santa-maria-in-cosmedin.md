title: "Santa Maria in Cosmedin"
location: {lat: 41.8880752, lng: 12.4816333}
interest: Home of the Bocca della Verita, which according to popular myth will bite off the hand of any liar who sticks his hand into its mouth.  The relics of a martyr, St. Cyrilla, are here.  There is also a dubious relic of St. Valentine.  The church today belongs to the Melkites (who are Catholic, by the way).
