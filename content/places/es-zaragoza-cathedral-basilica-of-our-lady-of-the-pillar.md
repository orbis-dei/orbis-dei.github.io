According to ancient Christian tradition, Mary appeared to the apostle James the Greater as he was preaching in Spain.  In 40 AD, while facing severe discouragement, St. James was praying on the banks of the Ebro River when the Blessed Mother appeared to him on a column, encouraging him to persevere in his missionary efforts.  This apparition is unique because Mary would have bilocated while still alive in Jerusalem or Ephesus.

#### Author's Note

Unfortunately many modern visitors to the cathedral are more interested in its rooftop views, so it's important to be specific when asking for accurate information about services.  The cathedral website lists their service schedule [here](https://catedraldezaragoza.es/culto/).
