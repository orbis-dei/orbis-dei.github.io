Original site of Holy Trinity College, the Vincentian college.  The school was later renamed to Dallas University/University of Dallas.  The school closed in 1929 and its charter was reused for the current University of Dlalas.

The building later housed Jesuit Prepatory School until it moved next to St. Rita and this building was sadly razed.
