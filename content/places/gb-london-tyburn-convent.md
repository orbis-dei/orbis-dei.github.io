#### Author's Note

To get to the relics room and Mother's tomb, enter the chapel, then exit the chapel by the door in the back right (while facing the Sacrament).  Descend the stairs and enter the room on the right.  The relics are in reliquaries with doors hanging on the walls.  Mother's tomb is in the courtyard behind the far wall from the door you enter in.  To get there, one of the doors to the left leads to a hallway that snakes around to the courtyard.
