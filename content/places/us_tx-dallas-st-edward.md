Founded by the Rt. Rev. Edward Joseph Dunne, bishop of Dallas, on Oct. 13, 1903, as the fourth parish in Dallas (Oak Cliff had just been annexed, so Blessed Sacrament was now in the Dallas city limits).  The name of the parish and the name of the bishop are not coincidence.

The founding pastor was the Rev. Joseph P. Lynch, who had been a priest for just 3 years.  Within a few years he would become bishop of Dallas.
