In Italian, Basilica of Nostra Signora delle Grazie e Santa Maria Goretti.  In the crypt below the church is her remains.  The bones are encased in a wax statue; she is not incorrupt.

The church contains a statue called Our Lady of Grace.  This may be the statue of Our Lady of Ipswich, which, along with Our Lady of Walsingham, was one of the largest pilgrimage sites in England up until the Reformation.

On the basilica grounds, to the left of the main nave is a gift shop.  The people there can help you get to her home in La Ferriere.
