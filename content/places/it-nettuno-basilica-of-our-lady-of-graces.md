In Italian, Santuario di Nostra Signora delle Grazie e Santa Maria Goretti.  The church houses the remains of St. Maria Goretti, and what is believed to be the statue of Our Lady of Grace.

The remains of St. Maria Goretti lie in the crypt beneath the basilica.  The bones are encased in a wax statue; she is not incorrupt.

The church contains a statue called Our Lady of Grace, which may be the original statue from Ipswich.  Our Lady of Ipswich, along with Our Lady of Walsingham, was one of the largest pilgrimage sites in England up until the Reformation.  During this period, Our Lady of Grace may have been smuggled to Italy.  In modern times, the faithful hold a procession with the statue on the first Saturday each May.

#### Author's Note

On the basilica grounds, to the left of the main nave is a gift shop.  The people there can help you get to St. Maria Goretti's home in La Ferriere.

The statue is credited with at least one historic miracle by St. Thomas More, but details are lacking; Miracle Hunter's page references the associated [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Lady_of_Ipswich).
