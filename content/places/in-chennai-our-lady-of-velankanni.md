## Introduction

There have been accounts of apparitions of the Blessed Virgin Mary at Velankanni according to oral tradition in the 16th Century. As tradition would have it, the first of many apparitions occured to a young boy who was delivering buttermilk. 


### The First Apparition


### The Second Apparition


### Rescue of a Portuguese Vessel

In the 17th century, a Portuguese merchant vessel sailing from Macau to Ceylon was caught in a severe storm in the Bay of Bengal. The sailors prayed fervently for Mary, Star of the Sea to save them, and promised to build a church in her honor wherever they could land. The sea became calm, and their ship landed near Velankanni on 8 September, the Feast of the Nativity of Mary.
