At this site, where an outdoor short stairway stands on the lottery building, is the site where Bl. Miguel Pro was martyred by firing squad.  These buildings were all built since that time.

#### Author's Note

Across the street, a bit above head level, is a commemerative plaque on the restaurant.  The restaurant is owned by a Catholic family who provide information on Bl. Miguel Pro. -JPY
