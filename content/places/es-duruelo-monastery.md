The first monastery established by St. John of the Cross and Fr. Antonio of Jesus in 1568, using a small farmhouse which had been donated to St. Teresa of Avila.  Soon the community outgrew the building, and moved to Mancera de Abajo in 1570, then Avila in 1600.

#### Author's Note

Additional history of the current monastery in Mancera de Abaio can be found [here](https://salamancartvaldia.es/noticia/2023-03-02-la-vida-en-el-monasterio-de-mancera-de-abajo-es-ilusionante-porque-cada-hora-es-la-de-amar-a-dios-316830), though it should be noted there is not a contiguous lineage back to the community founded by St. John of the Cross.
