In the 13th century, Our Blessed Mother appeared to a condemned innocent person in his prison cell. Bringing him a piece of wood and a knife, she told him to carve an image of the Blessed Mother with Child.  When he had done so, the jailers and judge were so moved they gave him back his freedom.  In gratitude for the divine assistance, the man sought to place the sculpture near a linden tree along the road, as Mary had suggested.  The present-day basilica was built next to this great linden tree, which was the site of many miracles and healings over the centuries.

With the Prussian occupation of Poland, the sanctuary was defiled and the linden tree cut down.  Upon Poland's independence, Jesuits were invited to renew the sanctuary, and it remains in beautiful condition to this day.

#### Author's Note

Because of the Jesuit influence, there are noticeable similarities to the Chiesa del Gesù in Rome, both in decoration and function.  The image of Our Blessed Mother behind the altar is covered after each mass, similar to some Jesuit churches in Rome.
