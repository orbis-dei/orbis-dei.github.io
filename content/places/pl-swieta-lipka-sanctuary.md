In the 13th century, Our Blessed Mother appeared to a condemned innocent person in his prison cell. Bringing him a piece of wood and a knife, she told him to carve an image of the Blessed Mother with Child.  When he had done so, the jailers and judge were so moved they gave him back his freedom.  In gratitude for the divine assistance, the man sought to place the sculpture near a linden tree along the road, as Mary had suggested.  The present-day basilica is located next to a great linden tree, which has been the site of many miracles and healings over the centuries.
