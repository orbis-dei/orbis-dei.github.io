Vincentian church housing the relics of Sts. Vincent de Paul and Jean-Gabriel Perboyre.  St. Vincent de Paul's heart is nearby at the more famous [Miraculous Medal Chapel](/places/fr-paris-chapel-of-our-lady-of-the-miraculous-medal).

#### Author's Note

An incredibly beautiful sanctuary of prayer, just a short walk from the often crowded Miraculous Medal Chapel.
