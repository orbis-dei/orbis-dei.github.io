This church was originally founded in the 13th century by Cistercians from France.  According to legend, around the year 1400, a merchant lost in the nearby swamps was led to the church by a figure he discerned to be Mary.  Out of gratitude, he commissioned a statue which can be found in the church today.

A regular visitor to the shrine was Karol Wojtyla, the future Pope St. John Paul II.  In August 1963, in his capacity as Archbishop of Kraków, the statue slipped during a ceremony and the future pontiff caught the scepter which had fallen out of the statue's grasp.  This scene was interpreted by many as a prophecy of his upcoming papacy.
