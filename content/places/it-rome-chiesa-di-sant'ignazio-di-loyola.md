title: "Chiesa di Sant'Ignazio di Loyola"
location: {lat: 41.8991867, lng: 12.4797362}
interest: 17th-century Roman Catholic church with trompe l'oeil ceilings & frescoes depicting St Ignatius.  The Jesuits did not have enough money for a dome, so there is a fake dome painted on the ceiling.  Sts. Aloysius Gonzaga, John Berchmans, and Robert Belarmine are all buried here.  From next to St. Aloysius' altar in the church, there is a stairway leading to his rooms, as well as the rooms of St. John Berchmans.
