This museum contains many of Bl. Miguel Pro's personal belongings, including cassocks, vestments, the suit he was shot in, and the cot where he slept the night before his martyrdom.

The location of Fr. Pro's arrest appears to be unknown, but the location of his martyrdom is known.

#### Author's Note

The hours are rather strange: certain days of the week in the middle of the day.  The entrance is to the left of the entrance to La Sagrada Familia.  The gift shop is also excellent.
