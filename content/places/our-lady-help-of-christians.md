In 1866, Magdalene Kade, an orphaned 31 year woman bedridden due to many illnesses, received a vision of the Blessed Virgin Mary, who immediately cured her.  A bishop's commission examined the miraculous event and recognized the healing and supernatural character.  A church was built by 1885 and elevated to a minor basilica by Pope Leo XIII, who officially consecrated it and dedicated to Mary, "Help of Christians."

#### Author's Note

It has been extremely difficult to find information on this pilgrimage site.  The "official site" above seems to reference several pilgrimage destinations in the area, and its worship times are outdated at time of writing.  We'd recommend checking the Facebook site for more up-to-date information.  -JMM
