In 1866, Magdalene Kade, an orphaned 31 year woman bedridden due to many illnesses, received a vision of the Blessed Virgin Mary, who immediately cured her.  A bishop's commission examined the miraculous event and recognized the healing and supernatural character.  A church was built by 1885 and elevated to a minor basilica by Pope Leo XIII, who officially consecrated it and dedicated to Mary, "Help of Christians."
