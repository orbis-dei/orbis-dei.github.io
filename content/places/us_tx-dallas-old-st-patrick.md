Part of the deal when the first parish in Dallas was named Sacred Heart was that the second church would be named in honor of St. Patrick.  This parish (which became the third oldest in the Dallas city limits once Oak Cliff was annexed) was located across from City Park.  The church was flattened by I-30, and where it once stood is now squarely in the middle of the Canyon.
