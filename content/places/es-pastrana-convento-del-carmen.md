The sixth of 17 communities founded by St. Teresa of Avila, in 1569.  St. John of the Cross may have written his *Dark Night of the Soul* and *Ascent of Mount Carmel* here.

In 1836 the convent was confiscated by the Spanish government, but in 1855 was reoccupied by Conceptionist Franciscan nuns.  Today it serves as a Conceptionist convent and Teresan museum.
