The school was founded in 1905 and the present church, the 5th church in Dallas and the 3rd oldest extant one, was built in 1910.  The original 1905 temporary church, later used as a parish hall, stood on the corner of Texas and Floyd and was extant in 2009, though it now appears to be gone.  The church was built by the Oblate fathers for the German population.

From 1977 to 2007, the buildings were used for St. Andrew Kim Korean parish, until that congregation moved to Farmers Branch.

This church is currently not in the possession of the Diocese of Dallas.
