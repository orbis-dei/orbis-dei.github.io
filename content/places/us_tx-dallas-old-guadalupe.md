Established in 1914 in response to the flood of Mexican refugees fleeing the anti-Catholic dictatorship in Mexico, this parish was merged with the cathedral in 1965.  This gentrified neighborhood was once Little Mexico.  All that remains on the site is an image of Our Lady of Gudalaupe.

The church was first served by Vincentians, who staffed Holy Trinity, then by the Carmelites.

St. Ann's school was located next to the church, and the building still stands today, containing a restaurant and a Japanese samaurai collection.
