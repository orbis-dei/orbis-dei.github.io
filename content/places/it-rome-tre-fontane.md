interest: Officially Church of St Paul at the Martyrdom, this church is located within a Cistercian (strict observance) abbey.  The name "Tre Fontane" refers to the three fountains the church is built over.  Tradition says that this is the spot where St. Paul was beheaded.  His head bounced three times.  Each place it bounced, a fountain sprang up.  Note that there are three churches at this monastery.  The church of Tre Fontane is the one furthest back.
