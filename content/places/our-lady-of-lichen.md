According to legend, the Virgin Mary appeared in Licheń, Poland to Tomasz Klossowski, a wounded soldier, in 1813 who was healed and discovered a miraculous portrait of Our Lady.  She then appeared to a poor shepherd, Mikolaj Sikatka, in 1850 who promoted her devotion.  She foretold of a cholera epidemic and interceded for the healing of many who sought her help.
