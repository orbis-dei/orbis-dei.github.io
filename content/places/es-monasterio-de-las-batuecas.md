The seventh of 17 communities founded by St. Teresa of Avila in 1578.  Its secluded setting reflects her desire for a life dedicated to prayer and contemplation.  As noted on the official site - the Carmelite Desert, more than a geographical place, is an interior experience of solitude and contemplation.

The monastery accepts pilgrims looking for a contemplative retreat.  Guests are invited to participate in community prayers.
