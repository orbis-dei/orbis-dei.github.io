Originally dedicated to the Sacred Heart, this parish is the oldest in the city of Dallas.  The parish merged with Our Lady of Guadalupe in the Little Mexico neighborhood (now Harwood) in 1965, and in 1977 the Cathedral was renamed in honor of Our Lady of Guadalupe.

In 2023 the cathedral was elevated to a National Shrine by the US Conference fo Catholic Bishops.

#### Author's Note

The original altarpiece appears to be lost forever.  It was removed in the 1960's by the Carmelite fathers who staffed the parish at the time.  The official story is that it was so badly damaged by termites that it had to be trashed.  Some say that it wasn't eaten by termites, but by Carmelites.
