In 1879, 15 individuals witnessed the figures of Mary, Joseph, John the Evangelist, and a lamb and cross atop an altar, all enveloped in a bright light outside the local church.  The imagery is unique to Knock and holds eschatological significance for Catholics.

#### Author's Note

Thanks to the testimonies of the visionaries, pilgrims today can experience a very accurate representation of the original apparition.  The statues have been placed in the same place as the apparition, in front of the church wall and slightly above ground level.
