Completed in 565 AD, the basilica was built over the believed burial site of St. John the Apostle.  According to legend, St. John (as the Beloved Disciple) took the Virgin Mary to Ephesus in her final years, and [her possible house](/places/tk-ephesus-house-of-mary) overlooks the ancient city of Ephesus.  The church is one of only four thought to have been built over the tomb of an apostle, alongside [St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City](/places/va-st-peter), [the Basilica of Santiago de Compostela](/places/es-santiago-de-compostela-catedral-de-santiago) in Spain, and St. Thomas Cathedral Basilica in India.

Today the ruins are part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Ephesus.
