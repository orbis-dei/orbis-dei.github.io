A miraculous crucifix appearing in a field resulted in the construction of a chapel on this spot.  The hole where the crucifix appeared is said to contain dirt that has healing properties similar to the water at Lourdes.  Hundreds of thousands of pilgrims visit the shrine annually, which, according to Catholic World Report, makes it the most popular pilgrimage site in the United States.
