Founded in 1478, this Carmelite convent in Avila was where Saint Teresa entered as a young woman and lived for 27 years. She took her vows here and began her journey as a mystic and reformer. The monastery features her cell, the Chapel of Transverberation and a museum dedicated to her life.

St. John of the Cross spent notable amounts of time here as well, and during one session of prayer, received a vision of Christ on the Cross from "above."  The saint's drawing remains at the museum.
