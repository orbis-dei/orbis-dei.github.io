Founded in 1478, this Carmelite convent in Ávila was where Saint Teresa entered as a young woman and lived for 27 years. She took her vows here and began her journey as a mystic and reformer. The monastery features her cell, the Chapel of Transverberation, a museum dedicated to her life, and a drawing of Christ on the Cross by St. John of the Cross.
