This cathedral is the reputed burial place of Saint James the Great, one of the twelve apostles.  According to tradition, his tomb was rediscovered in 814 AD by St. Pelagius the Hermit.  The church is one of only four thought to have been built over the tomb of an apostle, alongside [St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City](/places/va-st-peter), [the Basilica St. John](/places/tr-ephesus-basilica-of-st-john) in Turkey, and St. Thomas Cathedral Basilica in India.

One of the most famous pilgrimage destinations in the world, it lies at the end of the Camino de Santiago, or Way of St. James.  Today the church is the centerpiece of the larger Santiago de Compostela UNESCO World Heritage Site.
