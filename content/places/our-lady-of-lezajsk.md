In 1578, a pious woodcutter named Tomasz Michałek saw a bright light in the forest.  The Virgin asked him to alert the authorities to build a church.  Thomas, scared, did nothing.  The Virgin appeared again, asking him to take action and ending his silence.  Thomas approached the authorities but was not believed.  Under a subsequent priest, a small chapel was built, then a larger shrine in 1606.  Today the shrine is part of a larger Bernardine monastery.
