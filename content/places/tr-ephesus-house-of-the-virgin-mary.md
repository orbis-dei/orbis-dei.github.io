This house was discovered in 1881 based on the descriptions of Bl. Anne Catherine Emmerich, a bedridden German nun who had never left her own country.  Among other visions of the lives of Jesus and the Virgin Mary, Bl. Emmerich described the land around the house where the Virgin Mary may have spent her final years before her Assumption into heaven.

The Catholic Church has not issued an opinion on the veracity of the house, but several popes have conveyed blessings and visited the site.

#### Author's Note

There is a wall for pilgrims to leave prayers on small slips of paper or tissues.  As is the case at many Marian sites, there is a spring of holy water.

The gift shop at the site is quite expensive and does not appear to be run by Christians; likewise the parking fee is collected by local secular authorities.
