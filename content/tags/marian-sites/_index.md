title: "Marian Sites"

This page lists Marian apparitions, shrines and other devotional sites.

#### Background

Over time, there have been hundreds of reported apparitions of Our Blessed Mother.  For many years, there was no formalized approval process, so oftentimes the construction of a sanctuary or church would signify approval and recognition of the site.  Many of these "traditionally approved" sites have since been visited by bishops and popes who have encouraged the associated devotion.

In the modern era, reported apparitions are generally grouped into three categories:

1. __Constat de Supernaturalitate__ (Approved): Apparitions whose supernatural character is declared worthy of belief and contain nothing contrary to faith and morals.  However, belief in these is not necessary for salvation.
2. __Non Constat de Supernaturalitate__ (Nothing Contrary to the Faith): Apparitions which do not enjoy approval of their supernatural character but are determined to contain nothing contrary to faith and morals.
3. __Constat de Non Supernaturalitate__ (Not Worthy of Belief): Claims determined to have no characteristics that show them to be from God.

In addition to traditional sites, we have sought to present apparition sites from the first and second categories.
