title: "St. Maria Goretti"

At 11 years old, St. Maria Goretti fought off her would-be rapist, Alessandro Serenelli, who in his anger stabbed her 14 times.  She died a martyr of chastity.  In prison, she appeared to Alessandro, effecting his conversion.  Upon his release, he begged her mother for forgiveness and lived out his days working as a gardener at a monastery (he never became a monk).
