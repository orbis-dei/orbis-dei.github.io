At 11 years old, St. Maria Goretti fought off her would-be rapist, Alessandro Serenelli, who in his anger stabbed her 14 times.  She died a martyr of chastity, forgiving Serenelli on her deathbed.  In prison, she appeared to Alessandro, effecting his conversion.  Upon his release, he begged her mother for forgiveness and lived out his days working as a gardener at a Capucin monastery, eventually being accepted as a lay brother.
