#### Background

Blessed Stanley Rother was the church's first American-born martyr.  At the risk of his life, Bl. Stanley willingly persisted in his mission to the Tz'utujil people of Guatemala, saying "the shepherd does not run at the first sign of danger."  On December 1, 2016, Pope Francis confirmed that Rother had died a martyr, murdered for his faith, and Rother was beatified on September 23, 2017, in his home state of Oklahoma.
